# AetherLab 

> The project is aimed to run aether simulation and record results automatically. 

## Supported Simulations
- `DC Analysis` \- calculate the power consumptions in DC state;
- `AC Analysis` \- run the AC analysis to get the **Frequency Response** of the amplifiers, including **GBW, PM**;
- `Noise Analysis` \- get the noise reports to estimate the noise performance of the systems, including **Input Noise, Output Noise**;
- `Area Counting` \- calculate the total area occupied of the systems;

## Update Time lines
- `branch master` \- initial version of the project, created and finished in *2021/01* for the final exam of the students;
- `branch TA202101` \- modified version of the project for the **Teaching Assistor** in *2021/09 - 2022/01*
